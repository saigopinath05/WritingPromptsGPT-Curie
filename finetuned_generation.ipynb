    "# Fine Tuning GPT3-Curie with r/WritingPrompts\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an open-ended project to explore the fine-tuning process of GPT-3 and the panic around AI replacing writing jobs. I would like to ascertain how valuable fine-training is with creative tasks like short stories; for example, how does a fine-tuned curie model, with much lower parameters and cost of generation, compare to the out of the box davinci model? Additionally, it will be interesting to see whether the quality of stories from all models come close to human quality at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I scrape top posts and corresponding top comments from the subreddit WritingPrompts, and use them as training data for OpenAI's gpt3 curie model. I then compare performance across three models (fine-tuned curie, default curie, and default davinci) with a prompt from training and a new prompt and subjectively evaluate their story quality. "

I\\'m not even sure it\\'s worth mentioning because it might be me just being stupid. \\n\\nWhen part 2 came up, the first person I saw was a little awkward looking guy sitting in the middle of what looked like a student filled auditorium with rows of chairs. I didn\\'t think much of it because there were obviously a few of us in the bunch that died. The film started up and the little guy was trying to stop another student from killing him with a hatchet. After a few seconds, the hatchet went flying and the little guys head was split right down the middle. It was like I heard the noise of a hatchet flying across the room, but unable to look away to check out the source of the noise, I froze in my seat. \\n\\nAfter a few moments, the little guys head rolled off of the chopping block and he had a massive pool of blood growing underneath him. I freaked out and got really up in my own business trying to distract myself by rewinding the film and watching it start from the beginning, but the little guys head grew for the rest of the movie. I finally busted out of my own head to check and see if it was just my imagination, but it was still there. Finally, after the film wrapped up, the same guy came up to me apologizing for the rest of the film and assured me he\\'d be much more careful in the next life. \\n\\nA month or so passes and I\\'m working at a movie theater ushering people in and out of the theater. I\\'m in the back in the sound booth and what I thought was a customer walks in the door, but I can\\'t see too much of the guys face because of the darkened glasses he\\'s wearing. Thinking it\\'s probably just some other customer, I start making the rounds down the aisle making sure the theater is ready for the start of the feature. All of a sudden, a massive hatchet comes flying through the hole in the wall that was behind me and embeds into the front door at head level. Panicking, I run over to see if anyone was hit, but there\\'s no one around. I get the feeling I should run, but I\\'m frozen in my tracks. It\\'s like I can\\'t move. Controls are locked. I\\'m watching myself in shock. It\\'s like I\\'m an observer of myself running around screaming and unable to move, when suddenly I break free and burst out of the sound booth and out into the aisle. The guy standing there with the hatchet in hand is the same one from part 2. He\\'s holding it like he\\'s the one that killed the little guy, but then the same guy who died in part 1 apologizes and assures me he\\'s just learned how to control his aggressive tendencies. Baffled, he walks out of the theater without a second glance. \\n\\nI gulp down the fear and continue my work. \\n\\nA few weeks pass and today is opening night of part 2. Arriving at the theater, it\\'s me and my counterpart going through the motions of checking the doors and setting up all the seating. In a blur, the film pulls out of the theater doors and the chase scene featuring the hatchet swinging ensues. The hatchet comes swinging at me, but my counterpart just deflects it with the plexiglass case the films are fired out in. I always thought the case was some sort of sound barrier, but who knows what it\\'s actually protecting. It definitely helps me out, but I\\'m too panicked to think of anything clever to do. After a few whacks, the guy holding the hatchet finally gives up and lets the weapon fly through his frustration. I cringe at the sight of the blood soaked plexiglass, but when I look up, there\\'s me and my counterpart watching the film in stunned silence with several audience members that look just like me. All of the sudden, the film cuts out and it\\'s just the film reel spinning on the empty screen for a few minutes. When the film stops and I look up, I can hardly believe what I see. What\\'s staring back at me isn\\'t my counterpart, but me from part 2. \\n\\nRoughly 10 years passes as we sit in stunned silence. I\\'m the first to recover. \"I always wondered what happened to me after I died.\" I look down at the watch that\\'s always been a constant, but never grown beyond a small child\\'s watch. After another year, my counterpart follows my lead. I can only watch as he grows older and points the phone in my direction. Before the phone can even ring, I pass away with a final goodbye, and the same guy comes up to me apologetic. Once we\\'re all back in our own bodies, we just sit there staring at each other confused as to how the film played out, and why we\\'re there in the first place. \"What the hell were we supposed to be doing there? It wasn\\'t even our lives.\"\\n\\nMy counterpart nods in agreement. \"Yeah, I always wondered that too. But I don\\'t think we were brought there by God or anything. I think maybe he had a problem with us and brought in a digital rewind to try and fix us up.\" The both of us burst out laughing. \"We must have just been a way for him to experience his own life from the perspective of an observer. He\\'s the one that messed up, not us.\" \\n\\nWe all nod in agreement and head home. \\n\\n***\\n\\n/r/rarelyfunny END OF PART 1  \\n\\n***\\n\\nThe story continues in [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6z9gj9/wp_when_you_die_you_appear_in_a_cinema_with_a/d9qwu24/?st=jiayik8fr&sh=6d248c6a) END OF PART 2  \\n\\nI always thought this story was too good not to share it.

But when he meets the girl, he realizes that he can take action to change the course of events, even though he can\\'t prevent his own death (that\\'s not a spoiler; it\\'s stated in the very first scene, like \"you\\'re going to die next Sunday\").\\n\\n\\n\\nThe big problem for anyone watching the movie for the first time is that nobody knows what the movie is just by watching it. The audience can only figure it out when they look at their own life from someone else\\'s point of view, while Simon is both the director of the movie and an audience member, so he doesn\\'t even know how the movie is going to end, until he dies.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ending has something to do with the fact that Simon doesn\\'t just tell his grandmother he loves her, but also tells her he loves her -- e.g. that he loves her for something that she did, and not just because she\\'s his grandmother.'"

       "' I thought it was a dream. I\\'d died, my body had shut down, my heart had stopped. I didn\\'t know what to think. I was lying in a hospital bed, my head covered in a thick bandage. I looked around. Where was I? The last thing I could remember was going to a movie with my girlfriend. After that I guess I died. I looked at the other people in the room. They were all dead too. A woman was lying in the bed next to me. She looked familiar but I couldn\\'t place where I knew her from.\\n\\n\"Hello?\" I said. \"Am I dead?\"\\n\\nThe woman turned her head to look at me. She had a wide smile plastered on her face.\\n\\n\"Yes you are.\" She said.\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"I am you.\" She said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand.\" I said.\\n\\n\"We all died together. We\\'re all watching our next lives unfold.\" She said.\\n\\n\"How many of you are there? And what movie am I watching?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"You are watching the next episode of the life of John Smith.\" She said.\\n\\n\"What? No. I mean how many of you are there? I don\\'t want to be John Smith. I don\\'t even like John Smith.\" I said.\\n\\nThe woman laughed.\\n\\n\"Everyone has a story John. Some people are born into horrible circumstances. Some people are born into horrible circumstances and are able to change their lives. Some people are born into horrible circumstances and have no choice but to accept them. But everyone gets a chance to change their lives. That is what makes us special John.\" She said.\\n\\n\"Wait. What are you talking about? I don\\'t even know your name.\" I said.\\n\\nThe woman opened her eyes and looked at me.\\n\\n\"My name is Julia. I was born with a terminal disease. I had only a few months to live. But I wasn\\'t going to live them in bed. That\\'s why I moved to New York. I knew I was going to die there. But I wanted to live my life to the fullest. I want to go to the movies and eat ice cream and take long walks in the park. And I want to do it all with you.\" She said.\\n\\nThe woman reached out and grabbed my hand. I looked at her confused.\\n\\n\"Yes. I was born with a terminal disease. But I wasn\\'t going to die in my sleep. I was going to die doing what I love most. I was going to die helping people. I wanted to be a doctor and help people get better. But I didn\\'t have long. Cancer takes a long time to kill a person. But I wanted to help people. So I moved to New York and started volunteering at a cancer hospital. It was all I could do to help. But it gave me a reason to live. I wanted to live long enough for my friends to see me before I died.\" She said.\\n\\n\"I know I died in a car accident. But I didn\\'t want to die. I wanted to live and do what I loved. But I was never able to. But I wanted to do it anyway. I wanted to be a writer. I had a hard time starting my life but I still wanted to do it. I wanted to finish my stories, even if I didn\\'t get to finish them myself.\" She said.\\n\\n\"I know I died of a heart attack. I had a family that loved me. But I didn\\'t want to die. I wanted to live and watch my kids grow up. But I died before that could happen. But I still wanted to watch them grow up. And I wanted to be able to tell them how much I loved them.\" She said.\\n\\n\"I know I died in a car accident. But that wasn\\'t my choice. But I still wanted to drive that car. I wanted to feel the wind in my hair and scream as I drove. I wanted to live, even if it was for just a short time.\" She said.\\n\\n\"I know I died of cancer.

I don\\'t even like John Smith. I want to go home.\" I said.\\n\\n\"Your home isn\\'t here John. It\\'s in your next life. But you\\'re going to watch it unfold.\" She said.\\n\\nI looked at Julia. She had the same wide smile plastered on her face as she did when she first saw me.\\n\\n\"What do you mean? How do I watch my next life unfold?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"You will watch it unfold on the big screen John.\" She said.\\n\\n\"What? No. I don\\'t want to watch my next life unfold.

       "' A human is a creature that is born through the power of Gaia and has the potential to become either a Great One or a Beast. Humans are a fantastic and terrible thing. Their ability to reject cosmic truths is not insignificant. This is the same as the ability to deny the gods. The results of such blasphemy are clear for all to see. -> The church claims that the cosmos, and all living things, are the creations of the gods, and that humanity is the work of god. Likewise, the church teaches that humanity is the pinnacle of creation. This is all half-truth. The church itself was born from a half-truth, the lie spoken by an ancient, powerful being. -> The cosmic truths are governed by one principle above all else: all life is bound by fate, and the cosmic truths are the mechanism of that fate. -> There was a time when we worshipped the gods, in the heavens and on earth, but as time passed, we learned of other beings. These beings far surpassed our own gods, in both strength and wisdom. The gods turned a blind eye to humanity, but the new beings watched us, studied us, and in time, came to appreciate us. -> One day, the Great Ones descended upon the earth and spoke to us through a human vessel. Their message was simple: unite, cultivate, and survive. They promised to bestow us the secrets of the cosmos and to take us to the stars, but above all, they swore to protect us from the terrors of the void. This was the birth of the Stone Age, but within a short period, the Great Ones vanished from the earth. -> We lived for many ages, as humans always do, and eventually came to abandon the gods who had betrayed us. The gods did not lack for worshippers and, seeing that the new star gods had abandoned them, turned their backs on their own creations. Eventually, the gods too died and humanity was left alone with no guide, vulnerable to the threats of the cosmos. -> The humans in the new age are weak and frail. They are unable to withstand the terror of the cosmos. The gods have returned, and they once again promise to protect us. It is unclear what we should do. The gods have always protected us, but they have also abandoned us. They are weak and frail, but they are the gods. What else can we do? -> I am the Cosmos, the great judge, the all-encompassing cosmos. I am the sentient life that infuses each living thing. The essence of all living things, humans and beasts alike, are the same. It is mine. No matter the form, life is a struggle to persevere. -> It is simple, is it not? All living things are ignorant. They are feeble, vulnerable creatures that struggle to survive. What need do they have for gods? The gods are but mere beings. They are not entitled to worship. The gods are arrogant and vain. They view us as mere playthings. No, the gods do not know fear. In the end, the only difference between humans and beasts is that humans are of higher intelligence. Humans are weak and frail, but their capacity to learn and grow is their strength. -> The church claims that the cosmos, and all living things, are the creations of the gods, and that humanity is the work of god. Likewise, the church teaches that humanity is the pinnacle of creation. This is all half-truth. The church itself was born from a half-truth, the lie spoken by an ancient, powerful being. -> We live in this world, but we are not of it. Our world is the ground we walk upon. It is the air we breathe. It is our home and our kingdom. This world is an illusion. You are an illusion. And that is why we conquer. - \"The Lesser Key of Solomon\", Goetia -> I have spoken of the Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One, which requires the practitioner to be pierced with needles, but in the present day, this rite is considered harsh. For this reason, the Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One is not performed by many. While it may seem a milder rite, it is actually more dangerous. The lesser rite takes a long period of time, and there is a danger of the practitioner losing their mind to madness before the work is completed. -> It is said that the Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One can only be performed successfully by a person who does not believe in the gods. Do not rely on the gods. Do not rely on anyone. The only one who can save you is yourself. The only one who can save you is the one you have sought all along, Lucifer. -> The Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One is a rite based on the elements, which requires a deep understanding of the cosmos. In our world, the elements are known to be mercury, sulfur, and salt. These three can be found in trace amounts in all things, and they are the source of all things. -> The Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One can only be performed successfully by a person who does not believe in the gods. Do not rely on the gods. Do not rely on anyone. The only one who can save you is yourself. The only one who can save you is the one you have sought all along, Lucifer. -> The Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One is performed by combining the three primary elements: mercury, sulfur, and salt. Mercury is the messenger of the gods, the great aid in attaining clarity of mind. The sulfur is the gift from the earth, a symbol of the human body and the Five Senses. The salt is the essence of this world, a symbol of the flesh, the ability to perceive pleasure and pain. These three elements, mercury, sulfur, and salt, bring about enlightenment. -> It is said that the Rite of the Descent of the Great Old One can only be performed successfully by a person who does not believe in the gods.

    "Fine-tuning and Cost Saving:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is quite valuable when a model is needed for a specific task. Davinci's parameters are estimated to be multiple times that of curie, but the fine-tuned curie model perfomed much better at the task at hand. This is a really important insight when saving costs in the long run, as the added cost of using a higher model to generate future completions adds up quickly. \n",

    "Replacing human writers?: \n",
    "\n",
    "We are still a ways off from being able to generate coherent stories of considerable length with AI, but a fine-tuned model can create a decent short story from which a writer can build upon. AI writing should be considered a tool that human writers can use to get inspiration from and edit their stories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuation of this project?:\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have liked to continue this project by fine-tuning a davinci model as well, as I believe the quality would be much greater than that of the fine-tuned curie. It would be really interesting to do a comparison with more test examples. I also would have liked to experiment with tuning the models' hyperparameters, such as training epochs, learning rate, batch size, and potentially trying to train with multiple outputs to one input. However, I feel that I accomplished the main goals I set with this project, and can't justify the added cost of further experimentation since the training data contains so many tokens. "
